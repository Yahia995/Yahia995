# Hey there 👋

I’m **Yahia Achouri**, a software engineering student based in **Tunisia** 🇹🇳

I enjoy building useful things at the intersection of **AI**, **backend systems**, and **connected devices** 🤖 I like working end to end — from ideas and models to APIs and system design — and keeping things clean, simple, and scalable.

My main interests revolve around **applied AI (Computer Vision)**, **backend engineering**, and **smart systems / IoT** 🌐 I’m especially curious about how systems work under the hood and how different pieces fit together.

I spend most of my time working with Python, Java, C/C++, and JavaScript, and building systems using FastAPI, Spring Boot, React, Redis, Docker, and Linux 🛠️

I’m drawn to technology with real-world impact and to problems that require both technical depth and good system thinking ⚙️

When I’m not coding, I’m usually learning something new, refining an idea, or thinking about better system designs ✨
